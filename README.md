# Narrative-Driven Text-Based Role Playing Game (Tentative)
 
 > Authors: [Falak Tulsi](https://github.com/Tech13-08),[Yat Chun Wong](https://github.com/ywong042),[Andy Jarean](https://github.com/ajarean),[Tingxuan Wu](https://github.com/twu148)

## Project Description
> The reason we chose to make a Text-Based RPG is because the idea allows more room for creativity relative to other ideas for this project. From the characters to the story line, we look forward to making them flow together. 
>
> Naturally, an RPG is very open-ended which allows us to write virtually any story we would like to. Additionally, taking the concept of an RPG and limiting it to the terminal environment also piques our interest as developers. 
> 
> At this beginning stage of the project, we plan to develop the game using the C++ language in the Visual Studio Code IDE. For our version control, we plan to use git and maintain the project through Github. 
>
> We plan to make the input for our game be the user entering a letter/number to chose one of the options presented at any moment of the game. The output would be a string of text generated by our program that explains the state of the game based on the user's choice. 
>
> The features we plan to include for this game are the following:
> * `Items System`: Throughout the game, the user will have chances to get items each with their own ability. These items will include stat-increasing items such as healing potions and attack-increasing potions, as well as items for progression such as keys to unlock doors.
> * `Turn Based Battle`: As the user progresses in the game, they will encounter enemies to battle. The battle will go back and forth between the user's move and the enemy's move. The moves themselves will generally consist of normal attack, heal, use item, heavy attack, or escape.
> * `Locations`: The game will have multiple locations the user can travel to, each with their own purpose. These locations will consist of villages with shops, dungeons with enemies, etc.
> * `Story Line`: The game will a story line where the user may make choices to progress, but is ultimately linear. Wrong choices will delay the story, but may benefit the user with additional stats/items. The story concludes when the user resolves the final conflict and achieves the protagonist's goal.
> 
> The below specifications will be done if time allows:
>
> * `Character Selection`: At the start of the journey, the user will be able to select one of many characters who differ in weapons, armors, and special abilities. 
> * `Leveling System`: As the user continues their journey and battle more foes, they will gain experience points allowing them to level up. Each time they level up, the user will be granted upgraded stats for their character along with a chance for a special item.
> * `Improved Battle System`: Some enemies may have weaknesses which the player can exploit during combat to gain an advantage, such as delaying the enemy's turn or dealing additional damage. This adds an extra tactical layer to combat.
 > ## Phase II
 > We created three Epics that go over the main features and core aspects of our Text-Based Adventure Game. The first Epic goes over the how the Battle System should look like and the second Epic goes over the Character System. The last Epic goes over Locations of the game. 
 > The three Epics were split into six user stories so that we can work on them over the next several weeks and assign to team members during the scrum meeting.
## User Interface Specification

### Navigation Diagram
![Navigation Diagram](images/NavDiagram.png)
> Our navigation diagram [here](images/NavDiagram.png) represents how each screen of the game transitions to the next, as well as the overall flow of the game. The player begins at the main menu, at which they can decide to read a brief tutorial to learn about the game world and how to play it, or begin the game. From there, the player may progress from the village to the field and end at the dungeon. In each zone, players may interact with objects in the world (i.e. open doors, inspect the environment, etc). The player wins the game when they reach they defeat the final boss and reach the end of the dungeon. 

### Screen Layouts
![ScreenDesigns](images/ScreenDesigns.pdf)
> Our screen layouts [here](images/ScreenDesigns.pdf) illustrate our in-program screens and buttons. When the player starts the game, the very first screen is the Menu screen, which gives the player options to start and to quit. The player receives prompts and selects numerical options using the keyboard input to progress through the game. The combat screens all share the same layout, but have different enemies depending on the location the combat starts in.

## Class Diagram
![UMLClassDiagram](images/UML_Class_Diagram.png)
> Our UML class diagram [here](images/UML_Class_Diagram.png) represents the various classes we will implement in our project and how they will fit together. The diagram highlights the relationships between the classes and gives an overall idea of how the game will function. The player and enemies, for example, will both originate from the parent Character class. The Location class divides into the Dungeon, Village, Store, and Dungeon Room classes, which together become the map for the game. The Dungeon Room will have either enemies or items: both of which are classes with their own parameters and functions. The Game class is how we will manage all of these relationships at once to provide smooth game functionality.
 
 > ## Phase III
> We applied Integration Segregation principle to the Exp variable in the Character class since the subclasses Enemy and Boss do not need to inherit Exp from the character. We applied the principle by removing the Exp variable and the Exp methods in the class and also in its following subclasses in Enemy and Boss Enemy. This change removes unnecessary methods in the sub-classes and also reduces the possibility of those bugs.

> We applied Single Responsibility Principle in the Game class since it originally violated the principle by having the Battle System in the same class. We applied the principle by creating a new class to have the Battle System and removed the function in the Game class. This change gives the class only one responsibilities and separates bugs from Battle Systems if it does occurs.

> We used Listov Subistution in the Enemy and Boss subclasses. This works by having the subclasses have all the functionalities of the parent class Character. By doing so, we create a consistency so that we can use child and the parent the same way without creating an error.

> We used Single Responsibility Principle in the Enemy and Boss subclasses. The two subclasses do different jobs and are distinct enough from each other so we separated them into two child classes of Character. By doing so, we separate behaviors that don't have anything to do with each other, making it easier to debug if an issue arises in those areas of code.

> We have also used Single Responsibility Principle in the Location class and its subclasses. Every class there has one job only and do not contain behaviors from other classes. This makes it easier to develop Locations since each class does exactly as it is named and does not have any strange behaviors combined with it.
 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots

 ## Installation/Usage
 > Use git to clone the repository, and ensure that you switch into the repository.
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/cs100/final-project-ftuls001-ywong042-ajare002-twu148.git
 cd final-project-ftuls001-ywong042-ajare002-twu148
 ```
 > Since the repository does not contain the executable file itself, you will need to compile the code and make the executable using cmake.
 ```
 cmake .
 make
 ```
 > Afterwards, the main executable will be in the bin folder.
 ```
 bin/main
 ```
 > Enjoy! 

 ## Testing
 > For each main branch of the project (battles, movements, characters, etc.), we used Google Tests to run unit tests in order to ensure that each component worked individually before it could be merged. Here is a sample of some of the Google Tests. For the sake of brevity, some of the output (namely, the Battle code outputs responding to user inputs) has been omitted.
