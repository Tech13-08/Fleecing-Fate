 > Prompt text is any lines beginning with "\>"
 > Replace anything between \<...\> with your project specifics and remove angle brackets. For example, you need to name your project and replace the header right below this line with that title (no angle brackets). 
# Narrative-Driven Text-Based Role Playing Game (Tentative)
 
 > Authors: [Falak Tulsi](https://github.com/Tech13-08),[Yat Chun Wong](https://github.com/ywong042),[Andy Jarean](https://github.com/ajarean),[Tingxuan Wu](https://github.com/twu148)

## Project Description
> The reason we chose to make a Text-Based RPG is because the idea allows more room for creativity relative to other ideas for this project. From the characters to the story line, we look forward to making them flow together. 
>
> Naturally, an RPG is very open-ended which allows us to write virtually any story we would like to. Additionally, taking the concept of an RPG and limiting it to the terminal environment also piques our interest as developers. 
> 
> At this beginning stage of the project, we plan to develop the game using the C++ language in the Visual Studio Code IDE. For our version control, we plan to use git and maintain the project through Github. 
>
> We plan to make the input for our game be the user entering a letter/number to chose one of the options presented at any moment of the game. The output would be a string of text generated by our program that explains the state of the game based on the user's choice. 
>
> The features we plan to include for this game are the following:
> * `Items System`: Throughout the game, the user will have chances to get items each with their own ability. These items will include stat-increasing items such as healing potions and attack-increasing potions, as well as items for progression such as keys to unlock doors.
> * `Turn Based Battle`: As the user progresses in the game, they will encounter enemies to battle. The battle will go back and forth between the user's move and the enemy's move. The moves themselves will generally consist of normal attack, heal, use item, heavy attack, or escape.
> * `Locations`: The game will have multiple locations the user can travel to, each with their own purpose. These locations will consist of villages with shops, dungeons with enemies, etc.
> * `Story Line`: The game will a story line where the user may make choices to progress, but is ultimately linear. Wrong choices will delay the story, but may benefit the user with additional stats/items. The story concludes when the user resolves the final conflict and achieves the protagonist's goal.
> 
> The below specifications will be done if time allows:
>
> * `Character Selection`: At the start of the journey, the user will be able to select one of many characters who differ in weapons, armors, and special abilities. 
> * `Leveling System`: As the user continues their journey and battle more foes, they will gain experience points allowing them to level up. Each time they level up, the user will be granted upgraded stats for their character along with a chance for a special item.
> * `Improved Battle System`: Some enemies may have weaknesses which the player can exploit during combat to gain an advantage, such as delaying the enemy's turn or dealing additional damage. This adds an extra tactical layer to combat.
 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "User Interface Specification" and "Class Diagram" sections below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members
## User Interface Specification
 > Include a navigation diagram for your screens and the layout of each of those screens as desribed below. For all the layouts/diagrams, you can use any tool such as PowerPoint or a drawing program. (Specification requirement is adapted from [this template](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~mgrass2/cmsc345/Template_UI.doc))

### Navigation Diagram
> Our navigation diagram [here](images/NavDiagram.png) represents how each screen of the game transitions to the next, as well as the overall flow of the game. The player begins at the main menu, at which they can decide to read a brief tutorial to learn about the game world and how to play it, or begin the game. From there, the player may progress from the village to the field and end at the dungeon. In each zone, players may interact with objects in the world (i.e. open doors, inspect the environment, etc). The player wins the game when they reach they defeat the final boss and reach the end of the dungeon. 

### Screen Layouts
> Include the layout of each of your screens. The layout should describe the screenâ€™s major components such as menus and prompts for user inputs, expected output, and buttons (if applicable). Explain what is on the layout, and the purpose of each menu item, button, etc. If many screens share the same layout, start by describing the general layout and then list the screens that will be using that layout and the differences between each of them.

## Class Diagram

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
